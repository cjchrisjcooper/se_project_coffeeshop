# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Future plans include setting up the form on to a backend server so that the client can recieve reservations. Also the client is curious if we can set up an online order page that has a link in the header of the landing page so that customers can order coffee from online and pickup in the store. I told the client that they will need to set up an online money transfering system (Google pay, Apple pay, Paypal) first before I can set up a menu/online order page.
